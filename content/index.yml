    - quote: Love getting tickets for events through these guys. They are always reliable and anytime theres an issue they always resolve it in the best way for the customer. I also love the features of text support and facebook messenger because it allows problems to get solved so much faster than emailing! Most events send the tickets through eventbrite but I like buying from Bar Crawl live because they are super accomodating.
